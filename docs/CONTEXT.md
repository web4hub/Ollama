# Context length

Context length is the maximum number of tokens that the model has access to in memory.

<Note>
  Ollama defaults to the following context lengths based on VRAM:

  * \< 24 GiB VRAM: 4k context
  * 24-48 GiB VRAM: 32k context
  * \>= 48 GiB VRAM: 256k context
</Note>

Tasks which require large context like web search, agents, and coding tools should be set to at least 64000 tokens.

## Setting context length

Setting a larger context length will increase the amount of memory required to run a model. Ensure you have enough VRAM available to increase the context length.

Cloud models are set to their maximum context length by default.

### App

Change the slider in the Ollama app under settings to your desired context length.

### CLI

If editing the context length for Ollama is not possible, the context length can also be updated when serving Ollama.

```ini
OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH=64000 ollama serve
```

### Check allocated context length and model offloading

For best performance, use the maximum context length for a model, and avoid offloading the model to CPU. Verify the split under `PROCESSOR` using `ollama ps`.

```bash
ollama ps
```

```csv
NAME             ID              SIZE      PROCESSOR    CONTEXT    UNTIL
gemma4:latest    c6eb396dbd59    9.6 GB    100% GPU     131072     2 minutes from now
```
